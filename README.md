# Kannada Character Restoration Using AI

## 🖥️ Project Overview
This project aims to restore degraded or partially visible Kannada characters in handwritten notes using AI and deep learning techniques. The model predicts missing or degraded characters to generate readable text, preserving the cultural heritage embedded in Kannada manuscripts and historical documents.

---

## 📌 Key Features
- **AI-Based Kannada Character Restoration:** Trains a deep learning model to restore degraded Kannada characters.
- **Efficient Image Processing:** Uses 128x128 grayscale images for preprocessing and recognition.
- **Flask Backend:** Deploys the model via a Flask web application for easy access and interaction.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Helps preserve Kannada manuscripts and handwritten documents that are otherwise unreadable due to degradation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for AI model training.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the restoration model.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for serving the model and handling web requests.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Keras**: For building neural networks with the TensorFlow backend.
